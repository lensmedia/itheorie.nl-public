# Error codes
Error codes are prefixed with the HTTP status code and are returned in the response body as an error object with a unique error code, name and description.

These have the same properties for almost everything. One exception is validation errors (`validation_failed`), there are more fields there indicating errors for each field.

## Voorbeeld
```json
{
    "status": 418,
    "code": 418001,
    "message": "im_a_teapot",
    "description": "I'm a teapot"
}
```

:information_source: it can be that on https://test.itheorie.nl more properties are returned (depending on the set environment). These are for debugging purposes only and should not appear in production. Also note that this can contain sensitive information and should be treated as such.

It is advised to continue reading the [end points](end-points.md) documentation now and reference the summary below when you need to. Most errors are included on the specific end points documentation pages too.
